# Assignment 1 Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier

## Project Overview
In this project, you will implement a supervised Naive Bayes learner to classify pose from keypoints provided by a deep convolutional neural network. You will train, test, and evaluate your classifier on a provided dataset, and then you will have a choice of either extending this basic model in various ways, or using it to answer some conceptual questions about Naive Bayes.

## Dependencies
- pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib

## Usage
- To recreate the results, simply run each cell of `COMP30027_assignment_1.ipynb`
